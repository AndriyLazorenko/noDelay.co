### NoDelay.co

App helps to predict the impact of weather on airplane departure times and predict possible delays. After user input of the airports of departure and arrival and flight date, it uses a pre-trained machine learning algorithm based on historical data of delays and weather conditions to accurately predict the range of possible delay (in minutes) and probability of delay under such conditions based on historical data.
